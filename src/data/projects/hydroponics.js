  description: "An experiment conducted using a clinostat to determine varying magnetic field strength on speckled pea plants' height, mass, and sprouting in microgravity.",
  longDescription: [
    "To conduct the experiment, three experimental groups were established, each exposed to different magnetic field strengths. Each group consisted of pots containing five speckled pea plant seeds. A clinostat was designed to simulate microgravity conditions by rotating the pots at 40 rpm, positioned 0.55 meters from the center, effectively replicating 1.44% of Earth's gravitational field. Throughout the 15-day experimental period, all groups received a consistent amount of water, light, and soil. Plant height was measured daily, while mass was recorded at the end of the experiment. Sprout time was tracked by noting the day each seedling emerged above the soil.",
    "The results of this experiment indicate that increasing magnetic field strength in microgravity leads to greater plant height and mass, with faster sprouting times. These findings suggest that plants could serve as a sustainable source of food and energy for future space missions. Further research into plant growth under microgravity conditions will enhance our understanding and optimize their use in space exploration."
